### Project Tenure

June 2025 - Present

# About the project:

The phytoplankton marine atlas project (Phyto-MAP) is a compilation of observations of phytoplankton occurrences (presence/absence and abundance) in the ocean, emphasizing observations with microscopic observations resolved to species or genus.

The goals of the project are to:

  - facilitate analysis of phytoplankton observations throughout the ocean by collecting data from many sources and combining the data into a common format
  - enable the development and testing of species distribution models
  - refine our knowledge of niches of groups and species of phytoplankton,
  - make a global scale map of marine phytoplankton.
