    "text": "Project Tenure\nApril 2020 - Present\n\n\nAbout the Project:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) has been conducting systematic ocean observation programs to interpret the changing marine ecosystems. These ecosystems are influenced by natural temporal and spatial variability as well as human activities such as fishing, pollution, and global warming. As part of  international scientific initiatives, the IEO has collected and analyzed time series of oceanographic data since the 1980s. The observations were initially initiated on the coast of Galicia and later expanded to the Cantabrian and Mediterranean coasts. In 2007, the observation program was divided into two projects: RADIALES, which maintains monthly observations on the northern coast of Spain, and RADMED, which focuses on the Mediterranean coasts with a seasonal frequency. Deep water observations were also started in 2004 in Galicia and the Cantabrian Sea (RADPROF) and in 2006 in the Canary Islands (RAPROCAN). These projects, along with tide gauge networks and satellite data stations, are the foundation of the IEO’s ongoing ocean observation program.B/O Ángeles Alvariño, one of the oceanographic vessels that carry out the RADIALES campaigns.B/O Mytilus, the vessel most commonly used for RADIAL Vigo.\n\n\nRole in Project\nDue to the nature of the project, each oceanographic center generates an enormous amount of oceanographic data annually for multiple Essential Oceanographic Variables (EOVs). As part of the plan to improve the information gathered in the project, my main duty is to design and deploy the VGOHAdB database, to store all data produced by our research group.\n\n\n\nStructure of the VGOHAdB database\n\n\nMy primary responsibilities within this project are to design, create, and maintain the database, primarily integrating data from the RADIALES Vigo program. To this end, a workflow has been developed to facilitate optimal data collection for subsequent analysis, homogenization, and population of the database. The database is a relational database in PostgreSQL, with a data structure separated by origins and data types, related by unique identifiers for the operations performed.\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC BY-SA 4.0"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Benthic dinoflagellates of the genus Gambierdiscus produce ciguatoxins, compounds that when metabolized in fish and consumed by humans cause ciguatera poisoning (CP). This syndrome, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, has recently been reported also in subtropical-temperate latitudes such as the Canary Islands where CP events have been regularly detected since 2004. This study examined the effect of temperature on the growth of Gambierdiscus isolated from Canary waters: G. australes, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. excentricus, and G. silvae. From the temperature vs. growth curves, the maximum growth (µm), optimum temperature range for growth (Topt), and the temperature yielding maximum growth (Tm) were estimated for each species. The results revealed temperature-dependent differences in the growth parameters. G. caribaeus had the highest Tm and Topt, followed by G. australes, G. carolinianus, G. silvae, and G excentricus. G. australes tolerated the widest range of temperatures (from 15 °C to 29 °C), which may explain its broader geographic distribution, both worldwide and across the Canary archipelago. Neither G. excentricus nor G. silvae survived at 29 °C whereas G. caribaeus reached mean growth rates (± standard deviation) up to 0.19 ± 0.01 div.day−1 at that temperature, followed by G. australes (0.16 ± 0.01 div.day−1) and G. carolinianus (0.14 ± 0.04 div.day−1). G. caribaeus showed no measurable growth at 19°C, whereas G. excentricus and G. silvae along with G. australes appeared as the species better adapted to lower temperatures. In an intraspecific variability study of 12 strains of G. australes, the mean (± standard deviation) of µm and Tm were 0.17 ± 0.01 div.day−1 and 27.7 ± 0.5 °C, respectively. An analysis of the shapes and position of the cell nuclei at the different temperatures showed that nuclei characteristic of vegetative cells appeared mainly at 26 °C but extreme temperatures resulted in nuclei with a more variable morphology. The presence of putative zygotes at extreme temperatures (17 °C, 19 °C and 29 °C) suggests that sexual reproduction is promoted as an adaptive strategy which could play an important role in the expansion of geographic distribution of Gambierdiscus species.\n Back to Publications"

My work focused on the impacts of marine litter on coastal areas and how knowledge and awareness shape people’s response to and perception of the problem. I aimed to elucidate the dynamics between human activities and the marine environment, uncover ecological trends and foster a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between human actions and environmental health. My research analyzed the environmental impacts of marine debris and society’s involvement in its reduction and elimination. I uncovered the multifaceted impacts of marine debris and advocated for the implementation of sustainable practices and policies to mitigate its harmful effects.

Here we have challenged the idea of using the abundance of marine litter present in a zone to estimate the risk of NIS introduction. To test this, a targeted sampling of plastic bottles and fishing gear (ropes and nets) was performed along 22 beaches from the Cantabrian coast where ports have been reported as a source of biological invasions. All items with attached organisms were collected and recorded. Genetic barcoding was used to ascertain the species and identify NIS. In total 17 species attached to plastic bottles and fishing gears were identified. Three of them, found on the two types of items, are catalogued as invasive species: Austrominius modestus; Magallana gigas; and, Amphibalanus amphitrite. Prevalence and mean intensity of non-indigenous biota on plastic bottles and fishing gear were not significantly different. The abundance of barnacles in litter was significantly correlated with that found from ports in the same region. The results suggest that ropes are able to transport different marine organisms and NIS as plastic bottles do. Monitoring biota on marine litter could serve as an additional tool for NIS detection.\n Back to Publications"

To test this, a targeted sampling of plastic bottles and fishing gear (ropes and nets) was performed along 22 beaches from the Cantabrian coast where ports have been reported as a source of biological invasions. All items with attached organisms were collected and recorded. Genetic barcoding was used to ascertain the species and identify NIS. In total 17 species attached to plastic bottles and fishing gears were identified. Three of them, found on the two types of items, are catalogued as invasive species: Austrominius modestus; Magallana gigas; and, Amphibalanus amphitrite. Prevalence and mean intensity of non-indigenous biota on plastic bottles and fishing gear were not significantly different. The abundance of barnacles in litter was significantly correlated with that found from ports in the same region. The results suggest that ropes are able to transport different marine organisms and NIS as plastic bottles do. Monitoring biota on marine litter could serve as an additional tool for NIS detection.\n Back to Publications"

(Marine Sciences Program of Galicia) is part of the ThinkInAzul project.\nThininazul logo\nRecognized for its complexity, sustainability science requires interdisciplinary and ambitious research approaches. This complexity underlines the need for research that balances breadth with the pursuit of concrete and demonstrable impacts beyond the generation of new scientific knowledge. Galicia, with its extensive 1400 km coastline, unique estuaries and diverse ecosystems, coupled with a high population density and a marine-dependent economic and social structure, provides an ideal context for such marine research initiatives.\nIn the face of global change, it is crucial for the scientific community to intensify efforts to understand the state of the environment and marine resources, identify vulnerable areas, predict future scenarios - especially those involving global change - and develop measures to ensure sustainable exploitation of commercially important species, marine ecosystems, biodiversity conservation, protection of vulnerable ecosystems and the overall health of the marine environment. The resilience of the marine environment and society, as well as societal well-being and health, depend to a large extent on progress in these areas. This defines the strategic focus of the Marine Sciences Program in Galicia.\n\n\nRole in Project\nWork package 3 of the marine science program aims at adapting new analytical and optical technologies (among others) for the study of plankton communities, in order to analyze the state of these communities to measure the state of environmental quality. To this end, our working group performs plankton sampling tasks together with other Essential Oceanographic Variables (EOVs). We have also implemented new technologies for the characterization of plankton through image analysis (Cytosense and Planktoscope). My tasks in this project consist of adapting and updating the database to house all these new data, together with other data generated in the framework of the Programa de Ciencias Mariñas, as well as analyzing them for technical reports and scientific articles.\n To this end, we are in the process of expanding, remodeling and migrating the database to the servers of the Centro de Supercomputación de Galicia, which improves its access and scalability, and improves the capacity of interaction with other databases of the project and other external ones.The Finisterrae supercomputer, where the database is hosted\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC BY-SA 4.0"
