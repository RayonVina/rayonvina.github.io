(Marine Sciences Program of Galicia) is part of the ThinkInAzul project.\nThininazul logo\nRecognized for its complexity, sustainability science requires interdisciplinary and ambitious research approaches. This complexity underlines the need for research that balances breadth with the pursuit of concrete and demonstrable impacts beyond the generation of new scientific knowledge. Galicia, with its extensive 1400 km coastline, unique estuaries and diverse ecosystems, coupled with a high population density and a marine-dependent economic and social structure, provides an ideal context for such marine research initiatives.\nIn the face of global change, it is crucial for the scientific community to intensify efforts to understand the state of the environment and marine resources, identify vulnerable areas, predict future scenarios - especially those involving global change - and develop measures to ensure sustainable exploitation of commercially important species, marine ecosystems, biodiversity conservation, protection of vulnerable ecosystems and the overall health of the marine environment. The resilience of the marine environment and society, as well as societal well-being and health, depend to a large extent on progress in these areas. This defines the strategic focus of the Marine Sciences Program in Galicia.\n\n\nRole in Project\nWork package 3 of the marine science program aims at adapting new analytical and optical technologies (among others) for the study of plankton communities, in order to analyze the state of these communities to measure the state of environmental quality. To this end, our working group performs plankton sampling tasks together with other Essential Oceanographic Variables (EOVs). We have also implemented new technologies for the characterization of plankton through image analysis (Cytosense and Planktoscope). My tasks in this project consist of adapting and updating the database to house all these new data, together with other data generated in the framework of the Programa de Ciencias Mariñas, as well as analyzing them for technical reports and scientific articles.\n To this end, we are in the process of expanding, remodeling and migrating the database to the servers of the Centro de Supercomputación de Galicia, which improves its access and scalability, and improves the capacity of interaction with other databases of the project and other external ones.The Finisterrae supercomputer, where the database is hosted\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC BY-SA 4.0"

Using the bay of Gijon (Southwestern Bay of Biscay) as a case study, we studied the composition and potential transfer of the communities inhabiting three different environment components: 1) natural and artificial substrates from the international port of Gijon, 2) six proximate rocky beaches and 3) floating litter collected in the adjacent coast. A total of 717 organisms were morphologically identified and DNA barcoded using COI and 18S genes. In total 23 NIS were detected, six of them considered invasive in the area. The taxonomic profiles of the three environment components were significantly different, flotsam containing higher proportions of Hexanauplia and less mollusks, echinoderms and polychaetes than ports and beaches. Contrary to expectations, floating litter showed higher densities of native and exotic species than beaches or port surfaces. This and shared haplotypes between port, flotsam and beaches in some invasive species may indicate that marine litter could represent a new habitat for species to disperse into new areas.\n Back to Publications"

Relationship between beach littering, alien invasion and perception and awareness of adults and students were assessed. Litter levels were associated with port presence and showed relationship between environmental degradation, IAS and litter accumulation. Adults were more aware about both issues and their perception of litter and plant invasion were positively correlated.

Many studies point out the importance of a better management of this type of pollution. In this pioneering study, we have analyzed the distribution of macro-, meso-, and microplastics along the coast of Asturias (southwest Bay of Biscay, Spain). Significant correlation analysis suggests that mesoplastics are produced in situ by fragmentation of macroplastics. Differences between groups of beaches revealed the importance of maritime ports and fishing activities as sources of macroplastics and likely of microplastics as well. Another source of microplastics could be atmospheric deposition, especially for fibers. Multiple regression model allowed to confirm the utility of beach services like cleaning and trash bins to control macroplastics. These results emphasize the need of an integral treatment of marine plastic pollution involving fishers and maritime ports, as well as the importance of providing beach services.\n Back to Publications"

Results showed differences in perception between volunteers and non-volunteers, but not between children and adults. Interaction effect of age was found for awareness.

    "text": "Abstract\nFloating plastic debris, such as bottles and fishing gear, is a shelter for different species in the oceans. Litter may therefore help the spread of non-indigenous species (NIS). Here we have challenged the idea of using the abundance of marine litter present in a zone to estimate the risk of NIS introduction. To test this, a targeted sampling of plastic bottles and fishing gear (ropes and nets) was performed along 22 beaches from the Cantabrian coast where ports have been reported as a source of biological invasions. All items with attached organisms were collected and recorded. Genetic barcoding was used to ascertain the species and identify NIS. In total 17 species attached to plastic bottles and fishing gears were identified. Three of them, found on the two types of items, are catalogued as invasive species: Austrominius modestus; Magallana gigas; and, Amphibalanus amphitrite. Prevalence and mean intensity of non-indigenous biota on plastic bottles and fishing gear were not significantly different. The abundance of barnacles in litter was significantly correlated with that found from ports in the same region. The results suggest that ropes are able to transport different marine organisms and NIS as plastic bottles do. Monitoring biota on marine litter could serve as an additional tool for NIS detection.\n Back to Publications"

    "text": "Abstract\nMarine litter is often left by beachgoers. Thus, understanding beachgoers” perception and awareness is important. In this study, the amount and type of litter was measured from nine beaches of central south Bay of Biscay (Spain), and a survey about perception and awareness of the beach littering was conducted among beachgoers. The region could be considered moderately littered compared with other studies, with significant differences among beaches for litter amount and types. Plastic was the most abundant item, followed by fishing gear. Differences among beaches for awareness and litter perception correlated significantly with differences in litter amount. Perception was positively correlated with beach frequentation. Significant gender differences were found, males taking more actions against litter than females regardless how much litter they perceived. These results could be employed for designing campaigns of beach litter treatment and awareness raising, by taking into account local differences detected in this study.\n Back to Publications"

    "text": "Abstract\nMarine debris is currently a significant source of environmental and economic problems. Floating litter can be employed by marine organisms as a surface to attach to and use as spreading vector. Human activities are promoting the expansion of potentially harmful species into novel ecosystems, endangering autochthonous communities. In this project, more than 1,000 litter items were collected and classified from five beaches eastwards the port of Gijon, in Asturias, Spain. Next generation sequencing was employed to study biofouling communities attached to items of different materials. A dominance of DNA from Florideophyceae, Dinophyceae and Arthropoda was found, and four non-indigenous species (NIS) were identified. Results showed a clear preference of Florideophyceae and Bryozoa to attach on textile surfaces versus plastic ones. Considering that these taxa contain several highly invasive species described to date, these data emphasize the potential of textile marine debris as a vector for dispersal of NIS. Moreover, the closest beaches to the port contained a more similar biota profile than the farther ones, confirming that both plastic and textile marine litter can be vectors for species dispersal from ports.\n Back to Publications"

    "text": "Abstract\nBenthic dinoflagellates of the genus Gambierdiscus produce ciguatoxins, compounds that when metabolized in fish and consumed by humans cause ciguatera poisoning (CP). This syndrome, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, has recently been reported also in subtropical-temperate latitudes such as the Canary Islands where CP events have been regularly detected since 2004. This study examined the effect of temperature on the growth of Gambierdiscus isolated from Canary waters: G. australes, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. excentricus, and G. silvae. From the temperature vs. growth curves, the maximum growth (µm), optimum temperature range for growth (Topt), and the temperature yielding maximum growth (Tm) were estimated for each species. The results revealed temperature-dependent differences in the growth parameters. G. caribaeus had the highest Tm and Topt, followed by G. australes, G. carolinianus, G. silvae, and G excentricus. G. australes tolerated the widest range of temperatures (from 15 °C to 29 °C), which may explain its broader geographic distribution, both worldwide and across the Canary archipelago. Neither G. excentricus nor G. silvae survived at 29 °C whereas G. caribaeus reached mean growth rates (± standard deviation) up to 0.19 ± 0.01 div.day−1 at that temperature, followed by G. australes (0.16 ± 0.01 div.day−1) and G. carolinianus (0.14 ± 0.04 div.day−1). G. caribaeus showed no measurable growth at 19°C, whereas G. excentricus and G. silvae along with G. australes appeared as the species better adapted to lower temperatures. In an intraspecific variability study of 12 strains of G. australes, the mean (± standard deviation) of µm and Tm were 0.17 ± 0.01 div.day−1 and 27.7 ± 0.5 °C, respectively. An analysis of the shapes and position of the cell nuclei at the different temperatures showed that nuclei characteristic of vegetative cells appeared mainly at 26 °C but extreme temperatures resulted in nuclei with a more variable morphology. The presence of putative zygotes at extreme temperatures (17 °C, 19 °C and 29 °C) suggests that sexual reproduction is promoted as an adaptive strategy which could play an important role in the expansion of geographic distribution of Gambierdiscus species.\n Back to Publications"

Pre- and post-tests were performed to evaluate the knowledge acquired from playing the game. The game was also evaluated as an educational tool using a satisfaction survey. A general increase in the understanding of fisheries sustainable management concepts was observed (significant in the bachelor’s degree group), and the students exhibited a significant preference for this alternative teaching tool.\n Back to Publications"

    "text": "Abstract\nZooplankton studies carried out in NW Iberian waters, at the northern boundary of the Canary Current Upwelling System (CanCUS), were reviewed. Attention was paid to studies on zooplankton dynamics and its relationship with the variability of the environmental conditions since these investigations are fundamental to assess the suitability of zooplankton-based metrics as indicators of ecosystem status. Plankton communities have been suggested as ‘surveillance indicators’ that may provide cues to disentangled the variability driven by natural processes from that due to anthropogenic pressures and impacts. Updated zooplankton time series (1997-2017) for the section ‘Ría de Vigo’, including in the ongoing coastal ocean observing system RADIALES, were presented. The convenience of combining database management and data analysis tools was illustrated showing preliminary results from the analysis of the long-term and interannual variation of zooplankton seasonality at different organization levels: bulk properties (total zooplankton abundance); taxonomic groups (abundance of copepods and cladocerans); and indicator species (abundance of the congeneric, but with different thermal preferences, Temora longicornis and T. stylifera). The observed patterns were related to the variability of the main meteorological / hydrographic drivers in the area, Ría de Vigo and adjacent shelf.\n Back to Publications"

These ecosystems are influenced by natural temporal and spatial variability as well as human activities such as fishing, pollution, and global warming. As part of  international scientific initiatives, the IEO has collected and analyzed time series of oceanographic data since the 1980s. The observations were initially initiated on the coast of Galicia and later expanded to the Cantabrian and Mediterranean coasts. In 2007, the observation program was divided into two projects: RADIALES, which maintains monthly observations on the northern coast of Spain, and RADMED, which focuses on the Mediterranean coasts with a seasonal frequency. Deep water observations were also started in 2004 in Galicia and the Cantabrian Sea (RADPROF) and in 2006 in the Canary Islands (RAPROCAN). These projects, along with tide gauge networks and satellite data stations, are the foundation of the IEO’s ongoing ocean observation program.B/O Ángeles Alvariño, one of the oceanographic vessels that carry out the RADIALES campaigns.B/O Mytilus, the vessel most commonly used for RADIAL Vigo.\n\n\nRole in Project\nDue to the nature of the project, each oceanographic center generates an enormous amount of oceanographic data annually for multiple Essential Oceanographic Variables (EOVs). As part of the plan to improve the information gathered in the project, my main duty is to design and deploy the VGOHAdB database, to store all data produced by our research group.\n\n\n\nStructure of the VGOHAdB database\n\n\nMy primary responsibilities within this project are to design, create, and maintain the database, primarily integrating data from the RADIALES Vigo program. To this end, a workflow has been developed to facilitate optimal data collection for subsequent analysis, homogenization, and population of the database. The database is a relational database in PostgreSQL, with a data structure separated by origins and data types, related by unique identifiers for the operations performed.\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC BY-SA 4.0"
