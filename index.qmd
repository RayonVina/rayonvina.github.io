::: {#hero-heading}

I am a biologist and data scientist with a passion for the ocean.  
My work revolves around data management and analysis for my research group using R tools, focusing on the continuous historical collection of plankton and other essential oceanographic variables for ecosystem studies. I also develop tools to facilitate data collection, archiving, and compilation using PostgreSQL/SQLite databases for research.  
My work focuses on the integration of biology and data science to better understand our world's marine ecosystems.
